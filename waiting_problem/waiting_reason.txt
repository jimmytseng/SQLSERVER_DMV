--sys.dm_os_wait_stats
Contains information about all the waits encountered by threads of 
execution

--wait_type 
Name of the wait type.
--wait_time_ms 
Total time spent waiting in milliseconds.
signal_wait_time_ms 
--Total time spent waiting to get on the CPU, when no longer waiting on 
original cause of wait.
--RealWait 
Total time spent waiting on original resource. This is wait_time_ms less 
signal_wait_time_ms.
--% Waiting 
How much time this wait_type spent waiting as a percentage of all waits.
--% RealWait 
How much time this RealWait spent waiting as a percentage of all waits.
